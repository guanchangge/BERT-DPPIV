Finally, the benchmark dataset was randomly divided into training (DPPIV-TR) and independent (DPPIV-IND) datasets for cross-validation and independent test purposes, respectively, with a ratio of 8:2. Finally, the DPPIV-TR dataset consisted of 532 DPP-IV inhibitors and non-DPP-IV inhibitors peptides, while the DPPIV-IND dataset consisted of 665 DPP-IV inhibitors and non DPP-IV inhibitory peptides
